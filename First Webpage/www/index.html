                        The first heavy metal bands, such as <span class="bold">Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and Deep Purple</span>, attracted large followings although they were often criticized, a common occurance throughout the genre's history.

                        During the 1980s, glam metal became a commercial force with groups such <span class="bold">Motley Crue</span> and <span class="bold">Poison</span>.

                        Rock music became its own genre around the 1960s and was popularized by the success of bands and artists who caused the formation of sub-genres, an example being David Bowie with Glam and Art Rock.

                On most company websites you would typically see some legal text
                (i.e. §105-13. Prohibited persons.), copyright (VALV<span id="valveSuper">E</span>©) and trademark
                information, links, and some other stuff located here, but since the page looked a bit weird without
                a footer I'm going to add one anyway. Nevertheless, enjoy reading some dummy text that
                isn't <span class="italic">lorem ipsum</span> for once, completely defeating the point of just
                copy+pasting text into a tag and saving time in the process.
