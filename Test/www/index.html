            <h2>Disallowing students from using backpacks is unaccommodating and unnecessary for many reasons:</h2>
            <ul class="noBullet">
                <li>Many students arrive to school <span class="emphatic">already late</span> to class due to buses, making going to their locker an <span class="emphatic">unintuitive, class-disrupting</span> decision.</li>
                <li>Online textbooks are not always available, so students need to carry both <span class="emphatic">textbooks, tablets, and notebooks</span> with them from class to class to avoid being <span class="emphatic">tardy.</span></li>
                <li>Backpacks are <span class="emphatic">NOT a tripping hazard</span>, such as tablet charging cables and stacks of books strewn about the classroom floor, when <span class="emphatic">desks have a hook</span> to hang the bags from.</li>
                <li>Students who take their materials to and from school in a backpack <span class="emphatic">will not have room</span> to fit them in their lockers during the day, considering the fact that the lockers are about one foot wide and only slightly deeper.</li>
                <li>Needing to share lockers due to a lack of space reveals <span class="emphatic">poor planning</span> and an <span class="emphatic">unempathetic</span> stance on the situation.</li>
